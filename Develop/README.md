## Project Title
ReadMe.Generator

## Description
I created a command line application to create a professional readme.md. This file should dynamically generate a professional READ.ME file for any future project.

## Installation
I insalled node js, package.json, gitignore, nodemon modules, and the inquirer package. 

## Usage 
I used the inquirer package to prompt the user for information using the prompts of both "list and input" I used the async method of fspromise.writeFile which taked in a callback method-"promise". The writeFile path generates a new file with the data collected from the user. I also created an object modle of a README.md file which includes a table of contents that link to each section of file; each section of file is coded to take in the user input for key/value pair labled.
